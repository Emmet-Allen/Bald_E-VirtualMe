A virtual version of myself created with VRoid Studio. 
I haven't made concrete plans on how to use it, but currently I'm experimenting with the 
face tracking of VSeeFace and am using this model to test it. Though, because this is a model
that is similar to my apperance (as badly as it looks), the use of this model is protected under
Creative Common License, and its code is protected under BSD-3-Clause License.
